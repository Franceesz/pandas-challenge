## Background

This repository brings a python pandas solution in the education sector to analyze city's school district data. This project will help school board and mayor to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. This project used two datasets in csv format, one is [schools_complete.csv](PyCitySchools/Resources/schools_complete.csv) file wich includes the following informations in columns `Student ID`,`school_name`,`type`,`size`,`budget` the other dataset is [students_complete.csv](PyCitySchools/Resources) file which includes the followling information in columns `Student ID`,`student_name`,`gender`,`grade`,`school_name`,`reading_score`and `math_score`. For these analysis both datasets imported, merged, and the aggregate data diplayed in to python pandas dataframes. The project is conducted in Jupyter notebook to showcase, and communicate the analysis report the following link is created: [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ermiasgelaye/pandas-challenge/blob/master/PyCitySchools/.ipynb_checkpoints/PyCitySchools_starter-checkpoint.ipynb) 

## Observable Trends

* The dataset encompasses a total of 15 schools, 39,170 students. The total students average reading score is 81.87 which is higher than the average math score 78.98. When we see the passing rate reading (85.80%) has a higher rate than math (74.98 % ),the overall passing rate is 65.17%. These findings indicate that student's score more in reading than math.

* The school summary finding showed that from 15 schools 7 of them are found at the district level, and the other 8 of them found at the charter level. The number of students in schools ranged between 427 students (Holden High School) to 4976 students (Bailey High School). The general finding also showed that district schools have more students than charter schools. It is legitimate to conclude that district schools have more students than charter schools because of their geographical coverage

* Grade 11 students at Holden High School holds a higher average Math score (85) comparing all schools and grades. Holden High School grade 12 students possess a higher average reading score (84.698795).
